df = df[df['staff'] != '×']
df = df[df['staff'] != '休'] 
df = df[df['parsed_slots_count'] > 0]
# ... multiple operations

# After: Single vectorized operation
rest_patterns = ['×', 'X', 'x', '休', '休み', '欠', 'OFF', '-', '有', '特']
exclusion_mask = (
    df['staff'].isin(rest_patterns) |
    df['staff'].isna() |
    (df['staff'].str.strip() == '') |
    (df['parsed_slots_count'] <= 0)
)
df_filtered = df[~exclusion_mask]
```
